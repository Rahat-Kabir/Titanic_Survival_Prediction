Ahoy there! 🚢 Welcome to my Titanic Survival Predictor project! 🤖🌟  In this adventure, I explored the famous Kaggle Titanic dataset and harnessed the power of machine learning to predict who might've survived that historic voyage.

🚢 Exciting News! Just wrapped up a Titanic Survival Prediction project using machine learning! 🤖💡

I explored the famous Kaggle Titanic dataset, predicting who survived using Python and cool libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. 📊

Shoutout to Raqibul  Hasan's 'Hate Kolome Machine Learning' book for guidance, and a big thanks to ChatGPT and Google bard for being my problem-solving sidekicks. 🙌🔍

Thrilled to share the code on GitHub for anyone keen on machine learning adventures or Titanic history! Check it out and let me know what you think! 🌐🤓
